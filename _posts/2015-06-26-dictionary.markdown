Have some weightage in your final CG, so don’t risk even trying to solve it yourself.

“This Maths tut is like a girl’s attention. I just don’t get it.”

28. Fachcha

(n.)A fresher in college, i.e, someone in the first year of his college. Recognised by die-hard optimism and high hopes which soon vanish under the dying smoke of sutta and effect of certain liquid carbon compounds.

In an interview of  PM section:
“Haan, Kabir. Why should we select you in our group?”

“Sir, Main udna chahta hoon, daudna chahta hoon, girna bhi chahta hoon...

bus rukna nahi chahta”
“Bas kar fachche. You’re in.”

29. Poly

“Mere department mein bahaut poly chalti hai yaar”

30. Bhajans

(n.)A class of folders found on  DC++ containing educational videos which students watch, sometimes night-long. Available on a wide variety of subjects (read: categories) and are largely taste-dependent. It is highly recommended that you download and keep a few for on your hard disk, just in case the prof. announces a surprise quiz.

“Saale, teen baj gaye aur to soya nahi?! What’s up?”
“Kuch khaas nahi. Bas bhajan sun raha tha bhai. (poker face)”

31. DC++

 (n.) Remember back when we told you that the Cinema Club is what  stands between students and mass- suicides in IIT-R? Guess what- we were lying. Actually they do, to a certain extent. But the major responsibility for this stands on the shoulders of the geeks who have built this life-saving tool. Designed to share files, documents and videos of all sort, DC++ comes in handy when downloading complete seasons of Prison Break at ultra-fast speeds.

“Bhai DC++ ni hota toh mera kya hota!”

32. Prison Break

(n.) The T.V. series which every fresher invariably watches in his first year.

33. Breaking Bad

(n.) The T.V. series which every fresher should watch in his first year.

32. TA

(n.)Short for Teaching Assistant. Basically refers to a  Matka who can cause trouble in your life. As a rule of thumb, you should refrain from calling any M.Tech. student matka; more so if he takes your tutorial/practical classes. Avoid getting into trouble with them as far as possible.

“Duniya mei teen cheezei kabhi underestimate mat karna: I, me, aur apne T.A. ki  chaud”

33. Chaud

(n.) This term is IIT-R’s in-house version of aukat. Your reputation on the campus and your relationship status largely determine your chaud. People with a higher positive value of this variable can get shit done quickly. People with low/negative value can usually be spotted flocking around them. E.g.

“Hello sir. Mai Munna Jazzbaati. Suna hai iss college mei aapki kaafi chaud hai?”

34. Haddu

(n.) Term used by majority of R-junta to refer to anyone who is from Hyderabad or

Term used by Delhiites to refer to anyone who is from South India.

“Aur haddu! Kaisa hai be?” “I’m from Chennai.  TDC.”

35. Kholu

(n.) Literally meaning opener, in IIT- R this term refers to the person who opens the institute and/or branch by fetching the best rank in JEE-Adv. in the institute or the corresponding branch.

“Humaari branch ka kholu kaun hai be?”

36. Convo

1) (n.)Short for Convocation. Refers to a grand event where the graduating batch receives its degrees, sometimes from the hands of eminent personalities like Kapil Sibal. Students usually dress like it’s a funeral and have been often observed throwing their hats in the air- for no discernable reason whatsoever.

“Apni convo kab hai yaar?”



2) (n.) Convocation Hall. It is situated next to the Century Gate and hosts the Convocation Ceremony (hence the name). Freshers have to collect their forms and instructions from here when they join. To ensure that the hall is not put out of use for most part of the year, it is also utilised to host cultural events and guest lectures during college fests.

“Where is the convo be?”

37. Cogni certi

(n.)Short for Cognizance certificate. Is just like a Starbucks mocha: everyone craves for one, no one knows why. More than his participation; this piece of paper serves as certification of the receiver’s knack for making bad decisions. Similarly we have certificates for participation in Thomso.

“Hey. I heard you’re working for Cognizance organising committee this year?”
“Yeah” “But...why?”
“Cognizance is the second largest technical fest in Asia. Being part of its organising committee brings you in contact with some really talented

people, boosts your personality development and gives you an opportunity to explore various dimensions of college life.”
“Really?”
“Plus they give you a really cool certi. at the end”


38. GPL

(n.)The exact full-form of this acronym remains a controversy, so we will provide you with a less gross version. GPL stands for Grand Picchhwada Laat. It is the holy ceremony of constant butt-smashing that takes place:

On your birthday. 

On any day your friends feel like doing it. 

GPL is instantaneous. GPL is brief. GPL is fun (not for the person on the receiving end).

“Yar, the Prof made me Class Representative today.” “Abey dekh kya rahe ho, GPL lo saale ki!”
