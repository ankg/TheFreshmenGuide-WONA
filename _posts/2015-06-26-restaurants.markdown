##The restaurants at the end of the universe
\#OffCampusLife  

If the past, present and future of every civilization are characterized by the how, why and 
where; R would be borderline where. While most afternoons here are spent pondering _‘Where 
to have lunch today?’_, a few are also spent wondering _‘Why we even bother to check the mess 
food?’_. However, the ultimate question for almost every inhabitant here still remains _‘Which 
book to use as an icebreaker in parties when trying to chat with the opposite sex?’_  

The sole purpose of this guide's existence is to serve as an answer to this question. For reasons 
not limited to establishing authority, we shall also make an attempt to cover the other, more 
trivial, things.  

By now, we have already established that IIT R is big. No, not space- big. Not even KGP-big. We 
are probably peanuts to either. But we are big enough. What this means is that we can afford 
to spend ludicrous amounts  of land to serve as vast green spaces (stepping on which might get 
you  shot), to start endless construction projects promising inhabitants the juicy insides of a 
McChicken, or to _serve as offering to the winning team of the annual Inter IIT._  

While life goes on inside, it thrives outside the campus. We began with the dilemma students 
face to decide which restaurant to have lunch in. This is not because we have a lot of options, 
but mainly because there is very little differentiating either. If you want to have, say, Italian or 
Continental or Mongolian-African-American -extra-spicy, well, forget it. However, if you wish to 
treat yourself with a little paneer or chana-masala, well, here you go…  

The restaurants that exist outside the campus to serve as places to eat other than the mess and  
the canteens, offer very little for too much. In all this, perhaps the tea point by the side of the 
bus stand would be your second best option. The best, of course, would be the guy you think 
you know who just came back from home with a really heavy backpack.  

So, you can try the following places, _just_ for a change:  

###Prakash
The ultimate destination for nearly all of IITR junta seeking plain-vegetarian, budget-friendly 
meals. Their recipe of Paneer Butter Masala is a well-guarded secret. Legend says that once a 
dog discovered their recipe by accident. A few eyebrows were raised when soon after hot dogs 
were included in their menu.  

###Sagar
When people can’t get into Prakash, they go to Sagar. Period.
(PS: Sagar does serve a really good Club Sandwich, which tastes even better after its 
depressingly slow service.).  

###RP (Royal Palace)
Situated near Century Gate, Royal Palace is yet another Chapo point for IITR junta. Known for 
its dim ambience and excess oil in anything with gravy, RP is one of those places where you go 
when you are large in number. The place hardly looks like a palace, but it surely costs like one. 
The food is good, but the bill burns a hole in most pockets.  

###Olive
It is an ideal place for potential love birds. You can eat here without the fear of finding your 
single friends around, partly because they are single and partly because it’s so damn expensive. 
But if you’re someone who doesn’t care much about materialistic things like money, Olive is 
where you can gorge on some good quality paneer, chicken and pasta around Roorkee.

###CCD
Another potential snuggling spot. A longish walk from the campus, CCD is the go to place when 
you have had too many dates at Olive or when you have loads of money to burn. Although 
whatever Nescafe may say, a lot does not happen over coffee.

###Pizza Hut
It was only last year that Pizza Hut realized the growing stature of Roorkee and decided that 
they could no longer ignore it the way McDonalds does. The result of this epiphany is an 
occasionally crammed Pizza Hut Delivery outlet located near Olive. Turning Dominos’ pizza joint 
monopoly into a duopoly, Pizza Hut is another place that makes you grateful for having that 
worn out IITR Icard which guarantees you magical discounts all around Roorkee.  

_The person hired for writing restaurant reviews was fired at this point, when it was learnt that 
he was - no disrespect intended - a lowly, lifeless geek. The reviews after this were continued by 
a stoner follower of Lord Shiva, who like most followers of Lord Shiva, is perennially broke. It 
isn’t a coincidence that Lord Shiva dressed in animal skin while other Gods had more jewelry on 
than a Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri model. Anyway, these will help you a lot on days when your 
wallet has more air than a packet of Lays._

###Jain Uncle ki dukaan
For directions ask for Gaylord’s, which incidentally is an ice-cream brand and doesn’t refer to 
Lord Renly Baratheon. This small shack is barely visible amidst all the smoke of the (unofficially 
dubbed) Sutta Point. But if you do find it, it is going to help your broke ass a lot in the next 4 
years. It dishes out hot and edible food starting from Rs. 12 for a dish (with unlimited refills) 
and Rs. 3 for a roti. This is the place you eat at after you give that hot chick a chapo at Olive.<br />
_Downside_ - You’ll have rickshaw- wallahs and manual labourers as other patrons. That doesn’t 
do much for ambience.<br />
_Upside_ - Jain uncle, being the noble soul that he is, will probably let you eat on credit. This 
humble writer has had a balance of almost a 1000 bucks at the place, without once hearing a 
complaint.

###Tintin
Finding Tintin by yourself is a mammoth task, even Christopher Columbus couldn’t find it. 
Located in an unassuming house in a remote corner of the remote place that Roorkee is, no one 
even remotely beats Tintin’s mushroom burger. What it lacks in the form of ambience it makes 
up for with its reasonable prices.  
  
###Satkaar Cafe
This one lies at the end of a long narrow lane in Civil Lines (which will remind you of the 
Mombasa chase sequence in Inception) which is ingeniously utilised by the Roorkee junta for 
guess what? Yeah, smoking again. Anyway, this is another low cost option you’ll explore when 
it’s the end of the month and you’re on your last few rupees. The price range is similar to 
hostel canteens though the preparation is better. Especially the Alloo Parathas with fresh 
curd!<br />
_Downside_ - Getting through the narrow lane. <br />
_Upside_ - Cheap food.  

###Sardarji ki dukaan (aka Bus-Tee for reasons unknown)
The fact that this is the only place open at 3 am in the morning should be enough to make this 
your favourite place in Roorkee. On top of that, it serves what is probably the best Maggi in 
Roorkee, complete with butter floating on top.<br />
_Downside_ - Dragging your stoned self all the way to the bus stand since there are no 
rickshaws that late at night.<br />
_Upside_ - Munchies.  

###Badshaah
This one is the Mona Lisa of Chicken shacks in Roorkee. No one really loves it but everyone 
visits it for the historical value. Don’t get us wrong. The chicken there is good but not very 
different from what you’ll get at Food Point or New Food Point (which your seniors will know 
as Sizzlers) without having to go into the smelly streets of Old Roorkee.<br />
_Downside_ - A 100 rupee rickshaw fare.<br />
_Upside_ - An Afghani Chicken that is so loaded with cream that you’ll smell of it for the next 5 
days.
