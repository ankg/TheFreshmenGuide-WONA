###Introduction

The most dominant species of IITR (after dogs, trees and matkas) is homo sapiens. It is observed 
that the needs and wants of this species range from basic necessities (of food, sleep, territory, 
gaming and porn etc.) to a desire of social recognition and acceptance by the members of the 
same species. Contrary to Maslow’s need hierarchy theory (thanks to the Mess food of RJB), 
newly admitted members of these species give up the basic physiological needs quite early for 
acceptance into the established social order. This effect becomes obvious during the time of 
some events (recruitment for cultural society and posts for Cognizance Organizing team, for 
example).

Time has divided the humans living on IITR campus into several such groups, tribes and clans. 
Each one of them has its own traditions and values which differentiate it from other groups. 
The Freshman’s Guide attempts to mention some major groups and clubs that exist in IITR and 
their impact on a freshman’s life.


###Cultural Society

The cultural society (CultSoc) is one of the most diverse and happening groups of IITR, and 
provides the best (and perhaps the only) way to interact with girls whose profiles you stalk at 
unspecified times of the night. The only catch here is that most groups of the CultSoc have a 
recruitment process. Yes that’s right. So, if at all you are one of those shiny eyed freshmen who 
wishes to learn something and try out anything that mildly interests him, here’s the news: you 
can’t. Unless you are you are judged by a godly senior of that group who was judged by this 
other godly senior who in -turn was judged by god himself, you can’t be a part of that group. 
That is one of the sad realities of life at IITR and you’ll have to make peace with it. Though on 
the upside, this does increase the exclusivity of these groups- which might come in handy on 
your resume facebook profile.

The cultural society includes the following sections:

####Dramatics Section

The broadway of IIT-R, you can easily identify the members of dramatics section by their 
insanely loud voices and a deep, almost incomprehensible devotion to their scripts. Known for 
their fierce perfection in plays that make people laugh, cry, angry and, in a few cases, scared 
(we are talking about Badal Sarkar’s _Baaki Itihaas_ here), the dramatics section is known to 
perform 3 stage plays and one street play every academic year.

_Recruitment Cracker:_ Loud voice is a must. Rest are mere details.

_Downside:_ You will have a hard time adjusting to the audience of IITR. They laugh in every play 
at all the possible wrong moments, irrespective of the genre of the play.

####Choreography and Dance

The Choreography section is perhaps one of the toughest Cultural Society groups to get into. If 
you are a typical Indian dancer who reluctantly dances in baraat, this section is just not for you. 
Although, saying that it requires prodigious dancing skills (that make Mithun da go Kya baat, 3 
times) won’t be totally correct either. Choreo (in IITR lingo) trains part-time dancer IITians into 
complete performers. Their shows are generally filled with power-packed  [performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsHhjxK8jao), with 
the dance-forms ranging from Jazz, Western and Contemporary to typical Bollywood, Punjabi 
and South Indian. You get to glimpse their year-long hard-work in the cultural week, their 
performances in Footloose (Thomso event) and  [flash  mob(s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUWrjA2AJvg) they organize in Thomso and 
Cogni.

_Recruitment Cracker:_ Being a good dancer (in others’ opinion) is more than enough.

####Music Section

Music is a way of life in IITR. After being classified on the basis of gender, year, branch, group, 
societies and number of Bun Samosas you can eat in a day, you can be classified on the basis of 
the kind of Music you listen. Music Section of IITR consists of some very remarkable artists of 
the campus who showcase their talents and semester-long hard -work at shows like _Pehla 
Nasha, Dhun and Swaranjali._ The diversity of artists in this section is quite unique. From Indian 
classical to western hard rock, this group has all kinds of musicians, each with a distinct taste in 
Music. Selection in this group is based purely on skill.  

_Recruitment Cracker:_ Less chances of selection if you are just another aspiring IITian with 2.5 
months of practice on acoustic guitar (there are more than plenty).

####Cinematics Section

CineSec (in IITR lingo) is dedicated to film and video-making on campus. Equipped with 
professional cameras and instruments, CineSec is responsible for creating short movies, campus 
news and trends, interviews, animations, info-videos, event-coverages and feedbacks on events 
in IITR campus. This section deals in various aspects of movie making such as scripting, editing, 
direction and production. Their works can be found on their official [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nma4fAvCghI). Though 
it’s not always true, their work can be a little too abstract at times.

_Recruitment Cracker:_ A knowledge of filmmaking is not necessary. You just need to be a film-
enthusiast and show an understanding of what elements are required.<br />
_Warning:_ making a film/video is a very menial job and requires a lot of patience.

####Literary Section

LitSec or Litta, comprises of two sections: the Debating Society (DebSoc) and Quizzing Section. 
Unlike other sections this is an open group where anyone interested can participate without 
any restriction. DebSoc and Quizzing organize the freshman debate and quiz respectively. Apart 
from organizing frequent quizzes and debates throughout the year, they also send teams to 
compete in other colleges. If at all you feel inspired after watching The Great Debaters or 12 
Angry Men, we would advise you to give these two groups a try.

####Magazines

Under the aegis of cultural society, there are 2 magazines: WatchOut and Kshitij!

Watch Out! is the official news magazine of IIT Roorkee. As the name suggests, WoNA covers 
the happenings and ongoings of life at IITR along with the issues that surround the 
administration, placements, academics, cultural council and bhawans. The frequency of 
publishing is the same as Kshitij. The verticals in this magazine are: Editorial, News, Design, 
Finance and Web-Design.

Kshitij is the official literary magazine of IIT Roorkee. They publish stories and poems written by 
the students who are part of it and also host open editorials (in both Hindi and English). The 
frequency of publishing varies from 3-4 magazines per year. There are verticals in a magazine: 
Editorial (Hindi & English), Finance, Web-Design and Design.

Both the magazines are self-financed, i.e. the funds are raised through external financing from 
the market. The finance sections in the magazines do this job.

_Recruitment Cracker:_ Different cells require different characteristics: Writing for Editorial/News; 
familiarity with modern designing tools and web -development in designing and webD; a knack 
of convincing people and selling stuff for Finance.

####Audio & Lights Section

These two sections form the backbone of any event in the convocation hall, especially during 
the cultural week. The audio section manages the surround sound and the microphones, while 
the lights section does an amazing job of lighting up the convocation for the events. Apart from 
this, the Audio Section also hosts a radio show on the evening of Valentine’s Day. The show is a 
probably the only time when the radio is heard by entities other than night guards and 
insomniac souls. Students can dedicate songs to their paramours in this event.

_Recruitment Cracker:_ Nothing in particular. However, a preliminary knowledge of surround 
sound and circuitry would give you an edge in Audio. _A past experience of having set up diwali 
lights at home might come in handy while applying for lights._

####Programme Management

This section is famous for <br />
a) Helping in the organization of cultural events (mostly hosting, anchoring, designing and other relevant stuff) <br />
b) An extremely friendly sex -ratio in the group. 

The tales of PM recruitment interviews are famous in the institute, as the group mainly focuses 
on taking people who are right fun at the parties. Although the exact details of the work done 
by this section remain unknown (except from distant stories of spectacular chapos), this section 
plays is vital for the smooth progression of events and shows in the campus.

_Recruitment Cracker:_ Ability to talk, shamelessness and a frank attitude towards life, in general 
would help. Convincing ability is an added advantage, although the writers of the guide can’t 
figure out why that would be required.  

###Other Campus Groups  
<br />

####SDSLabs

SDSLabs is perhaps one of the most iconic groups of IITR. It’s initiation in 2010 acted as a 
symbol of hope for the geek community who were tired of being branded as uncool nerds and 
banished from the happening places in the campus. SDSLabs is the group that manages SDS, an 
open for all hobbies club section. SDS also includes various other sub-section like Mobile 
Developement Group, Linux User Group and PAG. _There’s however a dispute over the origin of 
SDSLabs. Some say it that it was established the same time as that of AT&T’s Bell Labs and 
helped in the development of Unix. We don’t believe them, as after all, Unix was made by God 
himself._ Apart from releasing the much popular JEE counselling results on the internet, 
members of this section are responsible for the following activities:

a) Winning arbitrary coding competitions and making the most media friendly stories for 
IITR (unlike the ones involving youtube clips and makeup products).

b) Developing really cool apps like Muzi, Study Portal and Filepanda and
rendering life-saving services of DC++. (check them out on:  [https://sdslabs.co/](https://sdslabs.co/))

####PAG

Programming and Algorithm Group is yet another extension of SDS. After Cricket, CS, DOTA and 
Ludo, Competitive Algorithmic Coding is one of the most famous sports of IITR. The 
International Collegiate Programming Contest organised by ACM society (ACM -ICPC) is an 
international coding competition. _It acts as a qualifier for the Inter Galactic reality show called 
‘So You Think You Can Code?’, organized on planet Betelgeuse 7._ Apart from being active on 
such inter- galactic platforms, PAG frequently organizes coding lectures and contests for lesser 
beings too. A typical member of PAG looks like an ordinary humanoid with unusually high 
activity in the cerebral cortex of brain. We don’t know what that is but it makes the person in 
question extremely smart and totally unfit for social gatherings and parties.

####IMG

Formed as IITR’s website management group in 2000-01, IMG was formally established in the 
spring of 2001 -02. It was set up as the first ever student organization to provide free and 
friendly online resources (not porn) to the IITR junta. Acting as a gathering point for aspiring 
web-developers, IMG quickly began to take responsibilities of Institute level projects such as 
the official website of institute, registration online and other ancient entities which if we 
mention, will only embarrass them. 13 years down the line, members of IMG have alienated 
themselves from the clutches of the administration and function as an independent student 
body (maintaining some vital apps of Placement Online and Academics).  

_Their frequent debates, on who-kicks-whose-arse with members of yet- another-student-body 
which also develops web-app, on Quora, provides healthy entertainment for people who are not 
a part of either._ (If you’re in campus, check them out on [http://channeli.in](http://channeli.in), intranet only)

Both IMG and SDSLabs prove a rallying point for aspiring web-developers and programmers. 

They enjoy grand chapos in their AC offices and make everyone jealous by posting about it on 
facebook.

####SPIC-MACAY

Society for Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Culture Amongst Youth, is an international 
organization and its chapter in IIT Roorkee organizes a plethora of cultural events throughout 
the year. The events, as the name of the group dictates, consist of Indian classical music 
concerts, folk dance groups, traditional drama, movie-screenings and other shows where 
there’s a possibility of you running into your Profs. Contrary to popular belief, the members of 
this section are probably the _most_ active members of any campus group- as seen by the sheer 
number of events they organize during the academic year.

####FSAE - Formula Society of Automotive Engineers

Brains whose neuron-transmitted electrochemical signals are so mechanical that they manage 
to fabricate a Formula Style Race car in a span of 365 days (which may appear the same they 
made last year but still different somehow), come into this group. The Formula Style Race car is 
engineered for an international collegiate Design competition called Formulae Student, 
organised by IMechE (Institution of Mechanical Engineers). The Race cars have already flown 
worldwide, from Australia in 2011 to UK in 2013, and have managed to secure positions as high 
as 2 out of 149. The group is aiming at producing an electric vehicle for Formula Student-UK 
2015.

_Recruitment Cracker:_ Some knowledge of car parts and interests in Cars will do the trick. If you 
are in Mech. Engg., then surely this group will be your extended family.

_Downside:_ A lot of books are required to be read, which becomes quite difficult if you have 
engaged yourself in other cheerful activities.

####Team Robocon

This rather innocent group of ambitious students of IITR came into headlines the previous 
academic year, after their spectacular performance in the Robotic Contests (Robocons) 
organised by Asia Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) and its member countries. Robocon is the 
biggest international robotics competition in Asia- Pacific region. The magnitude of the 
competition can be judged from the fact that only one team from a country is allowed to 
participate, with the host being allowed to field two teams. Participation in it requires the 
application from all field of robotics with the emphasis on concept design, Robot programming, 
etc to achieve a predefined goal based on a theme declared by host country.
Team Robocon of IITR finished 5th in the national stage and won the award for Best Aesthetic 
Robot.

####EDC

Entrepreneurship Development Cell, IIT Roorkee is a student group which aims to promote 
entrepreneurship in campus. IIT-R, being a placement centric institute (by that we mean people 
killing for jobs), has witnessed a very slow increase in the enthusiasm of students towards 
entrepreneurship. The members of this group, when not busy with their own startups and 
garnering crores of turnover for their companies, help in organizing talks, meetups and other 
events that aim to support other entrepreneurs of the campus.

####ShARE-IITR

The Roorkee chapter of the non-profit organization Sharing Analysis of Regional Economies 
(ShARE IITR), was established in 2007. The aim of this society, in their words, is to understand 
the complexities of local socio-economic issues through presentations, conferences and 
projects.

_The other less popular aim, like any other campus group, is to have fun in the parties._ The 
members of this group work on projects that aim at studying some global economic, business 
and social issues. They also organize quizzes, seminars and group discussions on the current 
strategies and research in real world.

####Cinema Club

In ancient days, the students of IIT Roorkee used to hold movie screenings for the R-junta every 
weekend where everyone, from professors to students, had a great time. Somewhere down the 
line (we think after the release of movies like _Jai Santoshi Maa_) the tradition was discontinued.
The Cinema Club was restarted this year by some brave souls. After two really fantastic 
screenings of newly released movies, it is exactly what stands between the students and mass-
suicides here in IIT-R. It organizes the special screenings of movies- partly because there is no 
other cinema hall within 15 kms of the campus *, and partly because the members don’t have 
much else to do. These screenings (which are free of cost, by the way) are met with much 
fanfare in a Convo bottled down to its full capacity.
