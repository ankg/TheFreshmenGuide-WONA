###Alpahar:

Alpahar is the oldest eatery on campus, rumored to have been here for nearly half a century. 
Last year in mid November, Alpahar was shifted from the heart of the campus to its present 
location near Khosla International House. Despite its remote location, Alpahar attracts a 
majority of students during the daytime. With the smell of hot simmering _doodh-patti_ (that’s 
tea with extra milk worth Rs.2), the _aloo pakoras_ and samosas in the morning, Alpahar turns 
out to be a brilliant place for morning breakfast and ensuing _bakar_ sessions of afternoon.  

###Nesci: 

(previously known as Bru(previously known as Nesci(previously known as….)))
This open space next to Student’s Club and PNB is the official hangout place for R junta, which 
does not know what to do with the cursed one hour breaks between classes. With a rather 
uncomfortable seating arrangement allowing no privacy for the couples, Nesci is perfect for 
passing time sipping coffee or iced tea with friends. The delicacies are not exclusive but the 
quality of food gets compensated by the friendly atmosphere.

###Student’s Club:  

A 40 inch LCD television combined with huge space for pool, billiards and snooker tables, this is 
the best hangout place in IITR campus. With sofas and separate rooms to accommodate the 
activities of the literary section, this place houses table tennis, foosball, carrom and chess tables 
for the R junta. The open space in front of the club serves as the most happening place during 
the time of Cognizance or Thomso. Events of Lohri celebration, flash-mobs and street plays take 
place here  

###MAC (Multi Activity Center):  

Inaugurated on the day of Obama’s visit to India this year (obviously not by him), MAC is 
intended to be the melting pot of cultural activities in IITR. This latest addition to gaon’s 
imposing skyline has been the source of numerous tantalizing rumors in the five years that it 
took to build as well as debates over its not so central location. Nevertheless, MAC houses an 
ostentatious auditorium, rooms for indoor games, eateries, dedicated rooms for sections of the 
cultural council and a clumsily built open air theatre. MAC is the reason behind growing 
property prices in the gaon, although it is rumored to be jinxed by thousands of pass outs who 
hoped it would be complete before they graduate.

###Hobbies club: 

Hidden in a discreet crevice behind the students club, the hobbies club houses the SDSLabs, astronomy, 
electronics and fine arts sections. It also caters to a number of miscellaneous fetishes like philately, 
numismatics and gardening. The presence of the Thomso and Cogni offices in the same building ensures 
a healthy buzz of activity around the year. 
The hobbies club hosts an annual exhibition that goes by the name of Shristi in the month of March.
It can be easily spotted by the presence of sculptures in highly inappropriate positions, and miniature 
dinosaur statuettes on its front lawn.

###CBRI:  

For quite some time, the location of this canteen was a closely guarded secret of the 
inhabitants of Sarojini Bhawan. The canteen is situated in the vicinity of Jawahar Bhawan. 
However, over the years, its popularity has increased tremendously. Nowadays it attracts a lot 
of wandering souls who crave the bite of crisp Aloo Parathas and vegetable maggi in the 
evening. The maggi served by the canteen is delicious and the friendly attitude of the uncle 
running this place puts it leagues ahead of the hostel canteens. There's only one downside 
though: it is frequented by couples because of its proximity to the girls’ hostels. So if you're 
single, eating at this place might act as a silent reminder of your lonely, miserable existence.  

###The Canal and Solani Aqueduct:  

Although everyone signs the undertaking form which promises that they won’t be going 
anywhere near the canal or aquedcut, there’s hardly any undergrad who hasn’t visited it once. 
The aqueduct is a marvel of civil engineering. Located approximately 2 kms from the Century 
Gate, the place is worth the pain of waking up in the morning for sunrise. The sound of white 
water flowing through the duct is a melody in itself. Unarguably the best place in Roorkee to 
spend time without any disturbance.

###Neelam(Movie Theatre?):

About 800m from the campus, there exists the only cinema hall (albeit barely) inside Roorkee. It 
usually screens B-grade Bollywood movies, whose names can put even Kanti Shah (of _Fauji Fauj 
Mein, Padosi Mauj Mein_ fame) to start looking for a place to hide his embarrassed face. There 
are exceptions to this rule, of course. Last time your authors <s>visited this theatre</s> passed this 
theatre on their way to a psychology conference, _Revolver Rani_ was premiering here. But then 
come to think of it, RR isn’t much different from a B-grade Bollywood fiasco either.
The theatre is cheap. Much cheaper than going to Haridwar or Dehradun to watch a movie. 
While we would not recommend this as a place to go when you need to catch a Nolan or 
Tarantino masterpiece (_supposing it showed one and assuming you are an adult_), you should try 
to visit this at least once during your stay.
