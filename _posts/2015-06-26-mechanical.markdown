_The Mechanical department was established in 1946. It faced many problems initially, most of which 
arose from one single bigger problem: a large and growing female junta. However after several 
corrective measures and proactive thinking this problem has been successfully addressed.[citation needed]
This department is mainly known for its (un?)healthy sex ratio, path breaking research, use of fancy 
technology and tendency to give orgasmic reactions at the sight of any company with a CTC greater than 
6 lacs._

The bachelor course for Mechanical Engineering at IITR can be broadly divided into the 
following subjects:

Thermal Engineering and Fluids, Manufacturing, and Machine Design & Robotics.

Apart from these subjects the curriculum also includes introductory courses to the other 
branches. Since some courses form the prerequisite form the foundation for the ones that 
follow as you move up the ladder, it is advisable to develop a thorough understanding in the 
subjects.

The one salient feature of this branch at IITR is the presence of various students groups in the 
campus who have undertaken projects closely relating to the practical aspects of what you 
study in the classroom. Team KNOx and FSAE aim at a full design and fabrication of All-Terrain 
vehicles and Formula cars; SAE and ASHRAE foster the concepts of Automotive Engineering and 
Thermodynamics; ASME for the robotics and also the newly emerging projects in 
Aerodynamics.

Although the average pay scale of a Mechanical Engineer is around 6-6.5 lac INR; industrial 
giants such as Shell, ITC and Schlumberger can offer placements as high as 30 lacs. Placement 
percentage is almost around 90-95%. The initial package may not be as high that for a CSE 
student but work done during the four years of college, if commendable enough, can promise 
you a steep growth.  

Walking into an IIT itself opens the doors to a plethora of career options. While many choose to 
stay onboard, others exhibit their dexterity at competitive/developmental programming, 
marketing and finance or realize that working at a consultancy firm is the safest bet.
One can also opt to pursue higher education in India or abroad. The masterâ€™s degree can be 
obtained in various disciplines. Some of the research areas pertaining to branch are: Rapid 
Prototyping, Robotics, Vehicle-to-Vehicle Interaction, Intelligent Automotive, Energy Efficiency/ 
Hybrid Technologies, INDUSTRIE 4., Smart Structures, etc. A good GPA along with some project 
undertaking can land you at a top notch university with little effort.

It is mandatory to do an internship after the third year. However it is always better to utilize the 
second year holidays as well. Internships can be done in an industry or can be of the research 
type, which is done under the guidance of a professor. Companies such as ITC, Shell, 
Schlumberger and Tata Steel recruit interns from the college while you can always apply to any 
firm off the campus. One particular perk of the internship is that you may end up with a job 
offer right after your work review, which saves you from the agonizing process of placements, 
which, for most of the candidates turn out to be a blood pressure escalating affair. You can also 
try for a foreign intern in countries such as Germany, Canada, Japan and USA with the help of 
various intern programs.
It would be a futile attempt to prepare an exhaustive list for all the career options available, 
because they are simply innumerable. This is the time you that you make your dreams come 
true, you just need to realize them before it is too late, and jump in with all the strength there 
is!
