_The department of Electrical Engineering is strategically at the worst location in IITR.
Strategically, because:_

_a) It is far from everything of vital importance: Alpahar, Nesci, Student’s Club and Ravindra 
Canteen. And directly in front of the Director’s house._<br />
_b) If an inter-departmental war breaks out, Electrical department will be hammered by the 
surrounding superpowers of Mechanical, Civil and EC departments._

_The undergrads of this branch are constantly exposed to age-old electrical machines that make 
funny sounds when they run. They are also on the receiving ends of requests by fellow bhawan 
inmates to repair their fans and geysers._

Electrical engineering at IITR deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics and 
electromagnetism in order to design, construct and maintain products, services, and 
information systems.

The coursework is undoubtedly rigorous but with proper time management and smart 
decisions you can sail through most of them along with extracurricular activities. Core Electrical 
subjects include Signal Processing and Instrumentation, Control System Analysis, 
Communication Systems, Power Electronics, RF and Microwaves. Apart from that, there are 
some courses from Computer Science Engineering and Electronics Engineering departments like 
C++, Microelectronics, etc. Concept of computing and recent applications of computer based 
systems in design, analysis and efficient operation of power systems, maintaining quality and 
security are also included in the course.

Electrical Engineering graduates could continue their education by specialising and doing 
research in fields like: Power Electronics and Drives, Power Systems, Electrical Machines, 
Control and Instrumentation, Applied Electronics, Embedded Systems, VLSI Design.  

Many premier Educational and Research Institutions regularly admit electrical engineers as 
graduate engineer trainees and Management Trainees to work on research projects. Research 
areas in the branch include Communication and Networking, Power Systems, Signal and Image 
Processing, Electromagnetics, etc. A Good GPA along with a graduate degree from IIT should 
hold you in good stead, while applying for jobs or higher studies.

There is no dearth of job opportunities in the public or private sector - such as Electricity 
Boards, Large Scale Industries, Manufacturing Plants, Power Corporations, Hydro-Electricity 
sector. EE is a versatile branch where students, with some extra effort, can expand their work 
area into Software, Core Electrical, Electronics as well as Non Technical companies such as 
consulting firms. 

Prominent companies which recruit from the college include: ABB, Bajaj International Private 
Ltd., Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), PGCIL, IOCL, Trident, Centre for Electronics Design 
and Technology, Crompton Greaves Limited (CGL), Siemens Ltd., Reliance power Ltd. and non-
core companies like Goldman Sachs, Google, etc. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Average 
salary for an Electrical Engineer graduate is between 8-10 lakhs per annum, though a few 
exceptional cases do reach a much higher sum.
