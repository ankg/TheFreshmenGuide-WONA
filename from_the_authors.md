All though this page should contain an obligatory copyright notice, we’re sure there was also one
on the last Pink Floyd album you downloaded illegally. So there’s not really much point in including 
one here. What we do feel there’s a point in including is: A no-offense notice. Because let’s face it- 
We value our existence (however meaningless some people think it might be) more than the fate of 
an informal guide completed over multiple sleepless nights, mostly under the influence of weed 
necessary medication.

We hope the guide pissed off at least a few people. It would be a mammoth waste of time and 
effort if it didn’t. However we promise that all offenses were meant to be just light-hearted jokes 
intended to burn up a few calories. (Okay well- most, if not all. A few might just have been to vent 
out personal frustration)

That said, we hope you wouldn’t mind much.

This guide has been brought to you by [Watch Out! News Agency](https://www.facebook.com/WatchOutNewsAgency?fref=ts). If you liked reading this- you can 
check out the rest of the stuff we do at our (now functional)  [website](http://wona.co.in). We would love to hear back 
from you.

So feel free to give us feedback. Even if it is just to send us a smiley, please do! You have no idea 
how much it would mean to us!
