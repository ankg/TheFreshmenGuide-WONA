					<p>
						The Freshman's Guide to IITR is a wholly remarkable reference book. Although it is just the
						second edition, the information present has been compiled and recompiled many times over 
						many years and under many different editorships. It contains contributions from countless 
						BTechs, MTechs, PhDs, Professors and Directors.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even though Watch Out! is proud to be associated with this guide and for bringing it to its final 
						shape, the exact authorship of this guide remains a mystery. While some believe that this guide 
						is as old as the institute itself, others argue that it originated sometime  <a href="http://www.iitr.ac.in/campus_life/pages/Groups_and_Societies+Watch_Out.html">in 1993 when a 
						slithering reptile was  observed in Govind Bhawan.</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						However, Watch Out! knows that none of these speculations are true at all. In fact, no piece of 
						information about the origin of this guide will ever be completely correct. Because this guide 
						doesn't exist at all. It is a mere twisted fabric of space and time which has temporarily 
						suspended your grasp on reality. Right now, at this very moment, you dear reader, are 
						experiencing vivid hallucinations which involve fainted visions of this guide. And slowly, but 
						steadily, these words are taking shape exactly the way you want them to take shape. This guide 
						shall tell you only what you need to hear about your new institute- nothing more, nothing less. 
						The entrails of this book shall be debated, argued upon and updated from time to time, but 
						none of this shall ever physically exist anywhere. Even if you ever happen to chance upon a rare 
						copy, it is probably your mind gone bonkers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nevertheless, this guide shall remain to be the ultimate authority over any matter legal, 
						financial, or otherwise pertaining to the equitable distribution of bun-samosa inside the 
						campus from now till infinity.
					</p>
					<p>
						So long.

											<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											IITR is big. Not as big as you might have thought. But it’s big enough to deter you from 
											attending boring lectures at 8am. Heck, 8am lectures in general. Along with the other benefits, 
											we can assure you the campus will always be more happening than the city outside. Well, 
											probably because there is no city outside. But don’t let that worry you, the other cities outside 
											are international partying places!
										</p>
										<p>
											The mind bogglingly awesome institute of IITR was established somewhere around the middle 
											of the 19th century. Although the exact year is mentioned <a href="http://www.iitr.ac.in/">somewhere in the depths of the official website</a>, many archaeologists, historians and marketing analysts claim that the institute is as old as the Indus Valley Civilization. This claim has been rubbished many times by the Archaeological Survey of India but uncertainty remains in the minds of ECE undergrads who 
											visit the Digital Hardware Laboratory every semester.
										</p>
										<p>
											The institute has its roots way back in 1845. It was the time when speaking in a British accent 
											did not make you a homo and wellington hats were very much in fashion, so much so, people 
											dressed up in 3-piece suits just to go have dinner in the Bhawan messes (where they were 
											served in silverware by turbaned waiters). In 1847 the institute was officially established. It was 
											renamed as the Thomason College of Civil Engineering in 1854 in honour of its founder, Sir 
											James Thomason, lieutenant governor 1843–53. Roorkee graduates played a role in 
											maintenance of the Ganges canal, construction of dam and irrigation projects like Bhakra 
											Nangal, the Rajasthan canal, the Aswan dam on the Nile in Egypt, and construction of 
											Chandigarh.
										</p>
										<p>
											<i>Apart from all of these creations it is rumored that the engineers of IITR also built the Eiffel 
											Tower, Leaning tower of Pisa, Great wall of China and Pyramids of Giza. The number of 
											pictures people upload on their facebook profiles during their foreign internships every year 
											substantiate this rumor.</i>
											This guidebook aims at presenting an almost unbiased, unadulterated and unprejudiced picture 
											of IITR to the incoming freshmen. You can use this guidebook as follows:
											<ol>
												<li> 
													Read through all the chapters one by one. 
												</li>
												<li> 
													As a reference.
												</li>
												<li> 
													As an icebreaker in parties when trying to chat with the opposite sex.
												</li>
											</ol>  
										</p>
										<p>
											You must not use it as:
											<ol>
												<li> 
													A textbook. 
												</li>
												<li> 
													Definitely not a textbook.
												</li>
												<li> 
													Something that you’d want your parents to read.
												</li>
											</ol> 
										</p>
										<p>
											So buckle up! And get ready to experience firsthand what it is like to be a freshman at IITR.
